# GitHub README output profile

This is the detailed contract for ODIN's `readme` output profile. The README is a full project manual for humans who want the short version first and the entire technical rabbit hole if they keep scrolling.

Use it when the caller asks for a GitHub README, repository documentation, README maintenance, or the `all` output profile. The broad output-selection rules live in `reference/output-profiles.md`.

The README is a **repository artifact, not packet content**. Two protocol rules are
therefore scoped differently here, and the difference is deliberate:

| Protocol rule | In the packet | In the repository README |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No wall-clock time in deterministic content | binding | **inverted**, a `Last Updated` date is required |
| REPO_ROOT must not be modified | binding | repository mutation remains opt-in; otherwise write `ARTIFACT_ROOT/outputs/README.md` |

Everything else, the no-invention rule, evidence labelling, secret redaction, applies
unchanged. If the caller did **not** ask for README maintenance, `./README.md` is
evidence like every other file and must not be touched.

## Mode selection (non-negotiable)

Decide before writing anything.

**FULL GENERATION:** when `./README.md` does not exist, or exists but is empty or
whitespace only. Create the file from scratch following the required structure below.
Overwrite entirely.

**INCREMENTAL UPDATE:** when `./README.md` exists and is not empty. Do **not** rewrite
the whole file.

- Update only what changed during the current session.
- Determine "changed" strictly from repository evidence: prefer git evidence
  (`git diff`, recent commits, files changed since session start); otherwise infer from
  file timestamps and metadata.
- Preserve existing wording and sections unless evidence requires a change.
- Patch-style edits only. Keep headings and anchors stable.
- If you cannot prove anything changed this session, **do not modify content**, except
  `Last Updated` / `Last Commit Date` if evidence supports it.

One narrow exception permits a full rewrite of a non-empty README: the existing file
predates this structure and lacks the required sections outright. Say so explicitly in
your response, with the reason, rather than migrating silently.

## Non-negotiable rules

- **Do not ask the caller questions.** Infer everything from repository evidence.
- **Do not hallucinate.** If you cannot prove something from files in the repository,
  write **"Insufficient Evidence"** and list what you searched.
- Prefer evidence-driven statements naming file paths, project names, module names,
  class and function names, and entrypoints.
- Avoid dumping large code blocks. Summarise concisely; include short snippets only
  where directly useful.
- If the repository contains several solutions, projects, services, apps or packages,
  **document each separately**.

### Evidence annotation

Conditional on what your environment can actually support:

- If you can reliably cite line numbers, every major claim is followed by evidence in
  parentheses: `(path/to/file.ext:123)` or `(path/to/file.ext:123-145)` or
  `(path/to/file.ext)`.
- If line numbers are **not** reliable, use file-path evidence only ,
  `(path/to/file.ext)`, and **do not invent line references**.

ODIN's own `static-analysis/symbols.jsonl` carries real line numbers for every parsed
symbol, so cite them when a symbol came from a parser. Do not cite line numbers for
claims drawn from prose.

## Dates

- A **Last Updated** section near the top, carrying today's local date from the
  environment.
- **Last Commit Date** when repository metadata provides it ,
  `inventory/vcs-state.json` records `head_commit_evidence.committer_date_repository_evidence`
  from a read-only `git log`. If no such evidence exists, write
  **"Insufficient Evidence"**; do not guess and do not fabricate a date.
- In INCREMENTAL UPDATE mode, only move a date when evidence supports it. Do not
  blindly bump.

> **Environment note.** The original form of this specification forbade running `git`
> because its host had no git executable, and required the IDE-injected repository
> context instead. ODIN's rule is the underlying one: **never fail because git is
> absent**. Where git is present, ODIN already invokes it read-only and
> `inventory/vcs-state.json` holds the result. Where it is absent, that file records
> the absence and the README says "Insufficient Evidence".

## Repository-wide analysis, scan everything first

Identify what technologies exist **before** writing. `inventory/roles.json` and
`inventory/files.jsonl` already classify most of this; confirm rather than re-derive.

**Language and build manifests (polyglot):**

- .NET, `.sln`, `**/*.csproj`, `*.fsproj`, `*.vbproj`, `Directory.Build.props`/`.targets`, `global.json`, `NuGet.config`
- Node/JS/TS, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `nx.json`, `turbo.json`
- Python, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements*.txt`, `setup.py`, `Pipfile`, `poetry.lock`, conda env files
- Java/Kotlin, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`, `gradlew`, `gradle.properties`
- Go, `go.mod`, `go.sum`
- Rust, `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`
- Ruby, `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`
- PHP, `composer.json`, `composer.lock`
- C/C++, `CMakeLists.txt`, `Makefile`, `*.vcxproj`
- Mobile, `AndroidManifest.xml`, `*.xcodeproj`, `*.xcworkspace`
- Frontend, `next.config.*`, `vite.config.*`, `angular.json`, `vue.config.*`, `svelte.config.*`, `remix.config.*`
- Monorepo tooling, `lerna.json`, workspace configs, bazel, buck, pants

**App configuration and secrets patterns:** `appsettings*.json`, `web.config`,
`*.config`, `.yaml`/`.yml`, `.env`, config folders; references to secret managers
(Vault, AWS/GCP/Azure secrets, SSM, Doppler, 1Password). Identify config **keys and
environment variable names**, never print actual secret values.

**CI/CD:** `.github/workflows/*`, `azure-pipelines.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, GitLab CI,
buildkite, teamcity; build scripts `*.ps1`, `*.cmd`, `*.sh`, make targets, npm scripts,
gradle tasks.

**Containers, IaC, deploy:** `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose*`, helm charts, k8s
manifests, bicep, terraform, pulumi, cloudformation.

**Source and runtime entrypoints:** all source extensions for detected languages;
entrypoints, route definitions, job schedulers, workers, CLI commands.

**Tests:** `/Tests/`, `**/*.Tests.*`, and framework configs, xUnit, NUnit, MSTest,
Jest, Vitest, Pytest, JUnit.

**Docs:** `/docs`, `/wiki`, ADRs, README fragments, diagrams, architecture notes.

`odin.py readme-scan` performs this sweep mechanically and writes
`readme/component-map.json`. Treat its output as evidence to confirm, not as prose to
paste.

## Technology discovery, do this first

- Identify the primary languages and frameworks, **ranked by presence and importance**.
- Determine whether the repository is: (a) a single app, (b) a multi-component system
  (API + UI + workers + libs), or (c) a monorepo with many packages.
- Build a **Component Map** from repository evidence. Per component: name (from project
  or package metadata), type (web app, API, library, worker, CLI tool, UI,
  infrastructure), language/framework/runtime, path, and evidence-based purpose.

## Framework-specific discovery, apply only what exists

For each detected ecosystem, document the equivalents of:

| | Area |
| --- | --- |
| A | Entrypoints and runtime boot |
| B | Dependency and package map, grouped by purpose |
| C | Composition, DI and wiring, if applicable |
| D | Data layer, ORMs, providers, migration strategy, stored-procedure usage summary |
| E | Integrations |
| F | Security, AuthN/AuthZ, CORS, CSP, headers, cookies, session settings |
| G | Observability, logging, metrics, tracing |
| H | Deep code index, prioritising core domain and service logic |

Skip an area entirely when the repository has no such thing. Do not invent a data layer
for a library that has none.

## Identity and voice

The first screenful should look like somebody meant to write it.

- Copy this skill's `reference/logo.png` into the README output directory as `logo.png`.
- Start with the logo, project name, and one-sentence project summary.
- Follow immediately with **The Rundown**.
- Keep the writing casual, exact, and human. Dry hacker humor is welcome in small doses.
- Commands, paths, versions, security findings, and limitations stay literal and boring. That is where boring is a feature.
- Avoid corporate filler, assistant boilerplate, em dashes, and en dashes.
- GitHub ignores custom README CSS, so do not depend on it. Use the logo, code fences, tables, badges, ASCII, and Mermaid for the theme.

Full voice rules: `reference/output-profiles.md`.

## Required README structure

Use these sections in this order. The exact amount of detail changes with the project, not the headings.

1. **Identity header:** `logo.png`, project title, and a short project summary.
2. **The Rundown:** combine the old business and technical summaries into one human opening. Cover what it does, who uses it, key workflows, components, runtimes/frameworks, data, integrations, security posture, CI/CD, observability, current maturity, and where a developer should start. Keep it readable. Do not split it back into two executive-summary sections.
3. **Last Updated:** today's local date plus Last Commit Date when repository evidence provides one.
4. **Table of Contents:** clickable anchors, including The Rundown.
5. **Repository Overview**
6. **Components / Projects / Packages:** Component | Type | Language/Framework | Runtime/Target | Path | Purpose
7. **Architecture Overview:** Mermaid only when evidenced; otherwise ASCII.
8. **Tech Stack and Dependencies**
9. **Project Layout**
10. **Getting Started (Local Development)**
11. **Configuration**
12. **Running the System**
13. **Deployment and CI/CD**
14. **Deep Code Reference:** include a **Cross-Reference Index** table. If a web/API surface exists, include **API Surface** with route/controller/endpoint, auth, request/response types, and implementation location.
15. **Data and Integrations**
16. **Security Notes**
17. **Observability and Monitoring**
18. **Common Tasks and Troubleshooting**
19. **Change Log:** meaningful product, architecture, compatibility, output, and security changes. Use **Added**, **Changed**, **Fixed**, **Removed**, and **Security** subsections when they apply. Do not invent versions or dates.
20. **Contributing / Coding Standards**
21. **License:** only if a LICENSE file exists; otherwise `Insufficient Evidence`.

## Readability

- Use tables and bullets heavily.
- Use collapsible sections (`<details>`) for large inventories, such as class lists per
  module.
- Keep the top of the README fast: quick-start links and where-to-begin pointers.
- Keep sections skimmable. Avoid walls of text. A joke can break tension; it cannot replace an explanation.

## Formatting constraints (non-negotiable)

These exist because they break real renderers. `odin.py readme-lint` enforces every one
of them mechanically.

**No em dashes or en dashes in generated prose.** Use normal punctuation instead. ASCII `--` remains valid inside real CLI flags and code.

**No emoji or icons in Markdown headings.** Any line beginning with one or more `#`
must be plain ASCII. Emoji in headings get corrupted to literal `?` when written to
disk on some systems, breaking both rendering and anchor links.

```
WRONG:  ## :rocket: Getting Started
WRONG:  ## 🚀 Getting Started
RIGHT:  ## Getting Started
```

Emoji may be used sparingly in body text, paragraphs, table cells, bullets, but never
in a heading line.

**No ampersands in headings.** GitHub's anchor generation for headings containing `&`
is unreliable across clients. Use "and".

```
WRONG:  ## Tech Stack & Dependencies
RIGHT:  ## Tech Stack and Dependencies
```

**Table-of-contents anchors.** With plain ASCII headings, anchors are simple
lowercase-hyphenated slugs. No emoji shortcodes, colons or special characters in anchor
hrefs.

```
## Getting Started (Local Development)  -->  #getting-started-local-development
## Tech Stack and Dependencies          -->  #tech-stack-and-dependencies
```

**Forbidden Unicode ranges, headings and body alike.** These render as `?` in the
GitHub web UI:

| Range | Block |
| --- | --- |
| U+2500..U+257F | Box Drawing |
| U+2190..U+21FF | Arrows |
| U+25A0..U+25FF | Geometric Shapes |
| U+2300..U+23FF | Miscellaneous Technical |

Safe replacements, and only these:

| For | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Directory and file trees | indented plain text, spaces and hyphens: `  - SubFolder/`, `    - file.cs` |
| Flow arrows | `-->` or `->` |
| Vertical connections | `\|` (ASCII pipe, U+007C) only |
| Horizontal lines | `---` or `===` |
| Boxes and borders | ASCII `+`, `-`, `\|` |
| Bullets | `-` or `*` |

**Architecture diagrams, preferred approach.** Use a ```` ```mermaid ```` flowchart
block rather than ASCII art whenever showing architecture, data flows or component
relationships. Mermaid renders natively on GitHub and sidesteps every encoding problem.
Fall back to ASCII `+`/`-`/`|` boxes only when the diagram cannot be expressed in
Mermaid.

## Process

1. Determine MODE from README existence and emptiness.
2. Scan the repository; identify languages, frameworks and tooling
   (`odin.py readme-scan`).
3. Enumerate all components, projects and packages, and their relationships.
4. Identify entrypoints, config, build, test and deploy artifacts per component.
5. Produce the README strictly from evidence, full overwrite in FULL GENERATION mode,
   affected sections only in INCREMENTAL UPDATE mode.
6. Run `odin.py readme-lint` and fix every reported violation.
7. At the very end of your response, **after** the README, in the terminal reply, not
   in the file, list **15 to 40 "Evidence Files Referenced"** as bullet paths.

## Relationship to the packet

When both deliverables are produced in one run, the README is a summary for humans
browsing the repository and the packet is the evidence base. Keep them consistent:
every figure in the README should be traceable to a packet artifact. Do not put a
number in the README that the packet contradicts.
